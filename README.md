# Project-1
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

There are 12 independent variables and 1 dependent variable. The following are deduced from careful analysis of the dataset:

The result above shows that 80% of the patients showed up, while 20% of the patients did not show up.

          We could say that there is no adequate correlation between gender alone and missing the appointment, as the proportion of male and female patients missing their appointments is the same as the general average.

      The proportion of Handicap patient showing up for appointment is almost the same thing as that of Non-handicap. Thus being Handicap only does not influence the 'No_show' for the appointment. neither does  SMS_received only influence the showing up of the patients for appointments.
Limitations
The combined effect of the 12 independent variables could have more influence on the dependent variable but the timelimit for the research analysis could not permit the careful examination.
